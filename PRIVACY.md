# Privacy Policy

**Effective Date:** October 18, 2025  
**Last Updated:** October 18, 2025

## Introduction

Urik is a privacy-first keyboard for Android. This privacy policy explains what data we collect, how we use it, and your rights regarding your personal information.

**Core Privacy Principles:**
- All processing happens on your device
- No data is transmitted over the network
- No analytics or telemetry
- No third-party tracking
- You own and control your data

## Data Controller

**Urik Development**

## Data We Collect

### 1. Learned Words (Encrypted)

**What:** Words you type or swipe while using the keyboard.

**Purpose:** To provide personalized autocorrect, suggestions, and word completion.

**Storage:** Encrypted local SQLCipher database on your device using hardware-backed encryption (Android Keystore).

**Details Stored:**
- The word itself (lowercase, normalized)
- Language code
- Frequency of use (count)
- Input method (typed, swiped, or selected from suggestions)
- Timestamps (when created, last used)
- Character count

**What We Don't Store:**
- Context or sentences
- Which app you typed the word in
- Your location when typing
- Device identifiers
- User identifiers

**Encryption:** Your learned words are encrypted using AES-256 encryption. The encryption key is stored in the Android Keystore, a hardware-backed secure storage system. If your device has a lock screen (PIN, pattern, or biometric), the encryption key is protected by this lock screen. Without your device unlock, your learned words cannot be decrypted.

**Fallback:** If your device does not have a lock screen configured, learned words are stored without encryption, and you will see a warning about this in the app.

### 2. Keyboard Settings (Not Encrypted)

**What:** Your keyboard preferences and configuration.

**Examples:**
- Theme selection
- Key size preferences
- Haptic feedback settings
- Enabled languages
- Suggestion display preferences

**Storage:** Local DataStore (Android Preferences API) on your device.

**Purpose:** To remember your keyboard customization choices.

### 3. Error Logs (Local Only)

**What:** Technical error information when the keyboard encounters critical failures.

**Details Logged:**
- Component name where error occurred
- Exception type and message
- Stack trace (code location)
- Timestamp
- Script/language context

**What We Don't Log:**
- User input or typed text
- Personal information

**Storage:** Local JSON file on your device (`error_log.json`), maximum 100 entries or 500KB.

**Purpose:** To help debug issues if you choose to share logs when reporting problems.

**Sharing:** Error logs are never transmitted automatically. You can manually export and share them via the settings menu if you choose to report a bug.

### 4. Temporary In-Memory Data

**What:** Recent words and processing data held briefly in RAM for performance.

**Details:**
- Last ~200 typed words (automatically cleared after 5 minutes)
- Spell check results cache
- Dictionary lookup cache

**Lifecycle:** Automatically cleared when:
- Data expires (5-minute time-to-live)
- You switch languages
- You switch to a different app
- The keyboard service stops

**Secure Fields:** When you type in password fields or other secure inputs, all processing is bypassed. No text is cached, spell-checked, or learned.

## How We Use Your Data

All data processing occurs locally on your device:

- **Learned Words:** Generate personalized suggestions and autocorrect
- **Settings:** Apply your keyboard preferences
- **Error Logs:** Debug issues (only if you share them)
- **Temporary Caches:** Improve typing performance and responsiveness

**We do not:**
- Transmit any data to external servers
- Use your data for advertising or marketing
- Sell or share your data with third parties
- Build user profiles or track behavior
- Use analytics or telemetry services

## Data Storage and Security

### Encryption

Your learned words are protected by:

1. **AES-256 encryption** using SQLCipher
2. **Hardware-backed key storage** in Android Keystore (Trusted Execution Environment or StrongBox)
3. **Device lock screen protection** - encryption key accessible only when device unlocked

### Network Isolation

The Urik keyboard has **no INTERNET permission**. It is technically impossible for the keyboard to transmit data over the network, even if compromised.

### Secure Field Detection

The keyboard automatically detects password fields, credit card inputs, and other secure text fields. In these fields:
- No text is processed or cached
- No suggestions are displayed
- No words are learned
- All processing is bypassed

## Data Retention

### Learned Words
- **Retention:** Indefinite, until you manually delete them or uninstall the app
- **Deletion Options:**
    - Clear all learned words: Settings → Privacy & Data → Clear Learned Words
    - Clear all data: Settings → Privacy & Data → Clear All Data
    - Uninstall app: Automatically deletes all data

### Settings
- **Retention:** Until you reset to defaults or uninstall the app

### Error Logs
- **Retention:** Maximum 100 entries or 500KB, automatically rotated
- **Deletion:** Settings → Privacy & Data → Clear Error Logs

### Temporary Caches
- **Retention:** Maximum 5 minutes, then automatically cleared

### On Uninstall
When you uninstall Urik, Android automatically deletes:
- All learned words (encrypted database)
- All settings
- All error logs
- All cached data
- Encryption keys from Android Keystore
